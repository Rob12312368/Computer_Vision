a. I used skimage.filters.threshold_otsu and
skimage.measure.regionprops.

Circle center: (242.8846852816852, 250.36586443366767)
Circle radius: 178.0525476769344
Circle area: 99546.51

b. (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-0)^2 = r^2 (assume the z of the center point is 0)
Since the point is at the surface of the sphere, the distance between the point and 
the center is r. We know x, y, a(x of the center), b(y of the center) , and r already, so
we can use this formula to solve z.

Because the point that is the brightest will defnitely be between the light source and the
center. Therefore, the normal vector of the surface will definitely point to the light source.
